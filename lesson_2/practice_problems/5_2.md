`integer`, `real` and `decimal` are three data types to store numerical
values. They differ on the type of values they hold:
* `integer` stores whole numbers
* `real` stores floating-point numbers
* `decimal` (or `numeric`) stores arbitrary precision number. They can
contain non-floating-point fractional values with a limited precision.
