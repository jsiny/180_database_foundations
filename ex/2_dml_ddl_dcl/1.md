SQL consists of 3 different sublanguages:
* Data Control Language (DCL)
* Data Manipulation Language (DML)
* Data Definition Language (DDL)

DCL is used to control access to a database; it is responsible for defining the rights and roles granted to individual users. Common SQL DCL statements include:

```sql
GRANT
REVOKE
```

DML is used to interact with the values stored in the tables, either 
to read, create, update or delete them. Common SQL DML statements include:

```sql
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
```

DDL is used to create, modify and delete the structure and rules of the
relations. Common SQL DDL statements include:

```sql
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
```
